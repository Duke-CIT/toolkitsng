# What's Kits?
Whether it's a new semester or project, starting is hard. That's why we're making Kits.

For faculty, TAs, or the person coordinating a study group, Kits takes the pain out of getting the people in your community access to the apps you're using to facilitate learning.

For learners, Kits gives you easy access to the apps for all your learning.

## Learning is hard, getting started shouldn't be

Finding out how to get started with a new course, project, or study group shouldn't be a painful part of your university experience. Kits is here to solve that.

What if every app and resource you needed for all of your learning experiences were accessible in a single place?

One place to see every learning opportunity, every app, regardless of the subject, credit, or teaching style, that's Kits. 

## Teaching is pretty hard too

When faculty or other community leaders want to try a new app, it should be as easy as possible to get it in the hands of learners.

The Kits App Store connects your learning community to apps with 1-click.

# What is the Kits App Store

The Kits App Store gives you quick access to app details, how it was selected, and the ability to add it to your learning community with 1-click.

For university IT, relying on any single solution, including the LMS, is a short-sighted strategy that provides suboptimal learning experience as a monolithic system cannot provide the best learning experience for all aspects of all learning communities.

We see the ideal university IT and academic culture as one of technological plurality and choice, not a single, forced enterprise option.

The best learning happens when appropriate apps are used in conjunction with active learning pedagogies.
