This is one of those sections I can't wrap my brain around. So, lorem ispum.

### Exclusions
Users who want additional customization (such as a specific URL, adherence to specific branding requirements, or more customized graphic design or functionality) should contact their school or unit’s IT staff. Custom approaches to WordPress (including graphic design, other themes and plug-ins and custom URLs) can be accommodated through other campus and external service offerings, which may require payment for development, design, hosting or other project costs.

Students who are considering using WordPress for online portfolios and sites that they would like to access beyond graduation, should consider developing a site in wordpress.com as their Duke NetID access to Sites@Duke will expire soon after graduation.  Students nearing graduation may also consider exporting their site from Sites@Duke and importing into wordpress.com.
