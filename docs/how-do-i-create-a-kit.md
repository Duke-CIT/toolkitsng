## How do I create a kit?

### Course Kits

When instructors login to Kits, they see a **kit for every course** for which they are an instructor of record in DukeHub.  Course kits are created automatically when faculty and students login to Kits.

### User-Created Kits

To set up a kit that is not an official Duke course in DukeHub, **click the Create Kit button** in the lower-right hand corner of Kits, then **Create New ****Kit**.

Once saved, your new kit can be found in Kits under the Project category.  If you have many kits, you may need to scroll down a little to see the Project category and your new kit.
