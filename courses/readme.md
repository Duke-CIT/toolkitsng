# courses
learn.duke could act similarly to the Canvas landing page, as a dashboard that can send users to whatever server their learning experience lives on.

Now, users can access sakai, extend, sites@duke, people.duke, whatever course sites from the same place.

## courses = groups
Adding a new learning experience starts with the group selection.

groups come from groupmanager.oit API to learn.duke

## Tasks done at courses
* create course cards/sites
* manage course memberships including add TAs and guests to the reference groups like you do on Toolkits.
* add apps from /apps to course
* add custom URL to course for apps that aren't in /apps
	* run domain level queries on all custom URLS to show what tools need to be integrated next and what integrations aren't working because users manually link instead
* complete the instructional tasks like create assignment once tools are enabled

## Questions for courses
* What happens with cross-listed courses? Is there a master group that's created?
