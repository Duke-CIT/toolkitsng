# appdb.duke.edu
* All apps and their apis
* presented via API to learn.duke or does it have it's own UI?

# groupmanager.duke.edu
* create groups
* manage group memberships
* presented via APIs to learn.duke


# learn.duke.edu

## Next steps

These feel like the MVP. Give us something to test with her students, other faculty, and Duke community and build the narratives around how to communicate these ideas.

* create a learn.duke mockup using Nancy Short's DLX course
* create a gutenhax.duke mockup using Nancy Short's DLX course


## What are the tasks?
* create course 'sites' 
* turn on the tools
* configure tools
* complete the instructional tasks like create assignment
* suggest an app be added to appdb
* basic add url of specific tool or block for things not in the ecosystem
* learnplatform like community around apps (personally not sure about this one)
* usage metrics
* discipline specific app management

## Outputs
* should help clarify the LMS's role in the future


# gutenhax.duke.edu

* making the UX feel effortless is really, really hard, but is the point. It's what makes it next gen.
* Just in time provisioning of a tool (LTI, CI, or API). Don't make a faculty click add warpwire, configure warpwire. Show them an add video button and when they click it, add and configure warpwire for their course in the time it takes the textbox to appear so they can either paste their youtube URL in or click the Warpwire icon. 
* There is no site info::manage tools. There is only create course content
* Remember, users don't want to use your app, they want to be done using your app. Faculty don't want students to watch a video, watching a video isn't learning. They want to have tomorrow's in class discussion about the meaning of the video.
* Gutenhax is the evolution of the syallbus. It competes against the word doc.
