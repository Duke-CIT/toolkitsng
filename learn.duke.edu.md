# appdb.duke.edu
* All apps and their apis
* presented via API to learn.duke or does it have it's own UI?

# groupmanager.duke.edu
* create groups
* manage group memberships
* presented via APIs to learn.duke
* What happens with cross-listed courses? Is there a master group that's created?
* Still have to be able to add TAs and guests to the reference groups like you do on Toolkits.


# learn.duke.edu

## assumptions
* We hear a lot about the the cognitive load that taking 5 courses taught 5 different ways on 5 different tech stacks has on students, does this affect that positively?

## Next steps

These feel like the MVP. Give us something to test with her students, other faculty, and Duke community and build the narratives around how to communicate these ideas.

* create a learn.duke mockup using Nancy Short's DLX course
* create a gutenhax.duke mockup using Nancy Short's DLX course


## What are the tasks done here?
* create course 'sites' 
* turn on the tools
* configure tools
* complete the instructional tasks like create assignment
* suggest an app be added to appdb
* basic add url of specific tool or block for things not in the ecosystem
* learnplatform like community around apps (personally not sure about this one)
* usage metrics
* discipline specific app management

## Outputs
* should help clarify the LMS's role in the future
* Open Source


# gutenhax.duke.edu

* making the UX feel effortless is really, really hard, but is the point. It's what makes it next gen.
* Just in time provisioning of a tool (LTI, CI, or API). Don't make a faculty click add warpwire, configure warpwire. Show them an add video button and when they click it, add and configure warpwire for their course in the time it takes the textbox to appear so they can either paste their youtube URL in or click the Warpwire icon. 
* There is no site info::manage tools. There is only create course content
* Remember, users don't want to use your app, they want to be done using your app. Faculty don't want students to watch a video, watching a video isn't learning. They want to have tomorrow's in class discussion about the meaning of the video.
* Gutenhax is the evolution of the syllabus. It competes against the word doc.

MS Word vs Google docs
The paradigm shift was about people. Real time collaboration vs single user document creation.

What is the paradigm shift from the status quo to this?

## thoughts from the future of online at duke panel
Mine - Faculty aren’t always risk takers, ‘coursera might not be around next year, so what will be here that I get guaranteed returns out of’. Good lesson for the toolkits project.

Pedro - globally networked teaching and research. how does that play into learn.duke? Is there an opportunity for inter-institution collaboration here?

Lots of talk about networked communities of learners. Does that have a place here or is this the thing that connects you to your communities quicker/easier?
Maybe part of the UI is linking to the community that gets created for every course? Every course gets a slack channel?
