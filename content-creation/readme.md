# content creation

A new way to create learning content, it is the evolution of the syllabus. It competes not against the LMS, but against the word doc.

> Making the UX feel effortless is really, really hard, but is the point. It's what makes it next gen.

> Remember, users don't want to use your app, they want to be done using your app. Faculty don't want students to watch a video, watching a video isn't learning. They want to have tomorrow's in class discussion about the meaning of the video.

An opposing model to apps, templates, and wizard, content creation focuses on just in time provisioning of a tool (LTI, CI, or API). Don't make a faculty click add warpwire, configure warpwire. Show them an add video button and when they click it, add and configure warpwire for their course in the time it takes the textbox to appear so they can either paste their youtube URL in or click the Warpwire icon. 

There is no site info::manage tools. There is only create course content


Inspired by Wordpress Gutenberg, content will be managed by the block. There will be standard text and web blocks that furl and unfurl content.

But there will also be content item blocks for all IMS Content Item integrations.

## Course content with an open-first mindset
Sharing doesn't have to mean exposing your students and the safe spaces we create for them to assess and discuss their learning. Consumer apps have solved this.

* export content to social networks
* export calendar
* export to sites@duke
* export to medium

Content created on the platform is abstracted from the course specific metadata making it more sharable.
