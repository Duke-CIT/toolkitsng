# Toolkits.next

## Phase 1

An app store UI built that allows searching/filtering for apps and has grouper group awareness.

A new interface for selecting and managing these apps in Sakai, indicated here by the + button on the left navigation. This overrules site info::manage tools

This calls the app store, but the UI is changed slightly as the interface knows it's inside Sakai via LTI and already knows what what group context we're in.

This should be applied to all platforms, wordpress, drupal, open edx, sakai.

## Phase 2

Several creation interfaces will be tested and built to accommodate the spectrum of users.

Shown here, a three step wizard that walks users through ways of teaching and what tools are offered.

## Phase 3

A new way to create learning content.

Toolkits.next could act similarly to the Canvas landing page, as a dashboard that can send users to whatever server their learning experience lives on.

Adding a new learning experience starts with the group selection.

Inspired by Wordpress Gutenberg, content will be managed by the block. There will be standard text and web blocks that furl and unfurl content.

But there will also be content item blocks for all IMS Content Item integrations.
