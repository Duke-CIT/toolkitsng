# Problem Statement
learn.duke is where learners start interacting with their learning communities. It connects them to a unified interface for accessing their instructional tools. 

We have observed that Toolkits isn’t meeting this goal, which is causing communities to either rely on a single solution, the LMS, or use unsupported tools - even when a supported alternative exists. 

How might learn.duke improve this to accommodate the entire range of learning communities, those that use a single tool, those using multiple supported tools, and those using their preferred, unsupported tools? 

How might learn.duke encourage our learning communities to more frequently use the best tools to meet their learning goals and taking less energy to do so?

# Goals
## Required
1. Provide a single place for students to see the classes they are in, access the tools those classes are using
    2. Does learn.duke get us any closer to reducing the cognitive load students had when taking 5 courses managed in 5 different ways? We've decided that solving this issue 
1. Present faculty with a catalogue of learning technologies for use in their courses with search, sort, and filter options.
1. Provide a single place for faculty to membership and technologies for their courses.
1. Provide information and workflows on learning technology management and policies. 
	* LearnTAC
	* process for how tools get added to apps
	* minimum requirements rubric from LTS, ITSO, procurement, accessibility, etc
	* provide a single point of contact for vendors and users to start the process of adding an app

## Stretch
1. Let know what they should do next for those classes.
1. Suggest tool packages, or standard sets of tool combinations, to help faculty accomplish their learning objectives.
1. Solicit suggestions for new tools Duke should support, then Duke can research support, automation and provisioning behind the new tools.

# Scope

* The scope of learn.duke is on courses at this time
* Technologies must be learning related, but are not limited to enterprise licensed. School, departmental, and unlicensed tools will also be listed
* learn.duke will be an open source licensed project

# Assumptions

* learn.duke will help clarify the LMS's role in the future
* SISS groups are auto-created, faculty don't have to create the group
* Toolkits and Sakai run as is in parallel with this effort.
* Once we are 'done' there shouldn't be a need for Toolkits anymore

> Faculty aren’t always risk takers, ‘coursera might not be around next year, so what will be here that I get guaranteed returns out of’. --Mine

* Will faculty be receptive to change when the output is their content, easily accessible and maneuverable for the future?

* Is there an opportunity for inter-institutional collaboration here?

* At the future of online at duke panel, there was  talk about networked communities of learners. Does that have a place here or is this the thing that connects you to your communities quicker/easier?
Maybe part of the UI is linking to the community that gets created for every course? Every course gets a slack channel?

# Hypothesis
What is each hypothesis and what are the baked in assumptions that would be detrimental if wrong?

* We hear a lot about the the cognitive load that taking 5 courses taught 5 different ways on 5 different tech stacks has on students, how does this affect that?

## What do we need to know that we don't know?




# Sections
learn.duke is comprised of the following sections.

* apps
* courses
* cms

We plan to add the following sections 

* templates
* wizard
* content-creation
* dlx
