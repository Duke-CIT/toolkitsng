# Designed learning experience
Users use a wide variety of tools in their everyday life, the tools update regularly, the users switch between them regularly.

Users want this agency in their learning experience. They want intuitive variety of their choosing.

This doesn't mean the LMS goes away, it does shift priorities away from it.

This doesn't mean we focus on making things 'prettier', it does mean we focus on the whole teaching and learning experience.

The smart phone is a good metaphor. Users are provided a default set of apps, like Safari, that represent the starting point, not the majority of functionality the phone is capable of.

They are also presented with an app store containing varied means of introducing new functionality and apps, like Chrome and Firefox, to them.

App developers use Application Programming Interfaces or APIs to bridge the gap between their ideas and users. APIs give developers the power to do almost anything

The learning technology ecosystem will contain all the pieces of this metaphor. 

* default apps (like the LMS or Box)
* app store (curated lists of approved or supported apps)
* app developers (both in and outside the university)
* APIs (connection points for users and app developers to customize their experience)

This results in a very specifically designed user experience the first time each user picks up a new phone and tremendous agency to customize that experience to meet their needs.

Provide students with a singular designed learning experience that pulls in the data from all tools connected to a course and streamlines the presentation of what to do next into something like Coursera or edX

> Design is solving a problem. Many things have to be designed before you approach the field of visual design and decide how things look.

The ecosystem is a shift in priority from administration of courses to designed experiences for teachers and learners.

This doesn't mean the LMS goes away
This doesn't mean things are 'prettier'

This means we, the stewards of the ecosystem, consider the whole experience of what it means to offer learning and to receive learning at Duke.

The learning technology ecosystem would provide intuitive, designed experiences for teachers and learners to do the following.
