### minimum requirements rubric for vendors includes items from LI, ITSO, procurement, accessibility, etc

### licensing pipeline
* depts and schools dont set limits like "only math courses"
* instead set limits based on your number of students, faculty, or courses
    * how can we avoid duplicate payment when a student takes multiple classes that use the same product?
* when you outgrow that, come talk to LI for a growth plan or transition to us for an increase on those limits
* when it outgrows LI, we work with OIT to transfer for enterprise licensing
