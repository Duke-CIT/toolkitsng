# How to contribute to this project

The quickest, easiest way to contribute is to comment on issues. Add to the discussion, help flesh out user stories, add assumptions we haven't realized.

As of this writing, Kits is a Duke University project, but we're looking for other institutional partners interested in collaborating deeply with us. Reach out to the Product Manager for Kits, jolie.tingen@duke.edu, if you are interested in partnership.
